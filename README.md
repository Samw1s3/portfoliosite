# portfoliosite
This website is the base design for my future web applications to live to allow my future employers to see my existing work and see if it aligns with what they are looking for in employees.

## Description
This website has links withing the page, located in the navigation bar at the top, that allow the user to navigate to a section they want to see specifically. Each image is also clickable link (as of now they go no where) they will open a new tab for the web applications to be seen. It is responsive to different size screens and can work nicely on a mobile phone, where all elements go into a single column.
